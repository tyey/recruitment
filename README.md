# Recruitment project
Get familiar with the project by quickly reviewing it structure.

Your task is to:
* Build project in terminal with `./gradlew clean build` and make sure build is stable.
* Design the REST layer according to standards which you think are the most important. Follow clean code and architecture principles which you are using on daily basis.
* Implement endpoints which:
  * allow to get all reviews of a product,
  * allow to add new review for existing product.
* Add openAPI with swaggerUI to test your solution.

Good Luck!
