# Recruitment project
Get familiar with the project by quickly reviewing it structure.

Your task is to:
* Build project in terminal with `./gradlew clean build` and make sure build is stable and all tests are green.

* Task 1
  * Design the REST layer according to standards which you think are the most important. Follow clean code and architecture principles which you are using on daily basis.
  * Implement endpoints which:
    * allow to get all reviews of a product,
    * allow to add new review for existing product.
* Task 2
  * Design and implement mechanism which will send all reviews from module review-source to module review-destination. 
  * All received reviews should be saved in a text file in module review-destination resource directory.

Good Luck!
